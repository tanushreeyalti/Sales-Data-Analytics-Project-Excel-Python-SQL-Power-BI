📊 End-to-End Sales Data Analytics Project (2026)

Excel → Python → SQL → Power BI

🔍 Project Description

This project is a complete end-to-end Sales Data Analytics pipeline, built to reflect how real companies handle raw business data and convert it into actionable insights.

I started with a raw and messy Excel sales dataset, cleaned and transformed it using Python (Pandas), stored the processed data in a SQL database, and finally created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance, revenue, and profit trends.

This project is designed to be resume-ready, interview-ready, and aligned with industry workflows used in 2026.

🧾 About the Sales Data

The dataset represents sales transactions and includes fields such as:

Order Date

Product Name & Category

Sales Amount

Quantity Sold

Cost & Profit

Region / Location

Customer Details

Challenges in Raw Data

Missing values

Duplicate sales records

Incorrect date formats

Inconsistent column names

Mixed data types

These issues were intentionally handled to simulate real-world business data problems.
