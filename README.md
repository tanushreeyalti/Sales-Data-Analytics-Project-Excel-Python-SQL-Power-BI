📊 **End-to-End Sales Data Analytics Project (2026)**

Excel → Python → SQL → Power BI

**🔍 Project Description**

This project is a complete end-to-end Sales Data Analytics pipeline, built to reflect how real companies handle raw business data and convert it into actionable insights.

I started with a raw and messy Excel sales dataset, cleaned and transformed it using Python (Pandas), stored the processed data in a SQL database, and finally created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance, revenue, and profit trends.

This project is designed to be resume-ready, interview-ready, and aligned with industry workflows used in 2026.

**🧾 About the Sales Data**
The dataset represents sales transactions and includes fields such as:
1.Order Date
2.Product Name & Category
3.Sales Amount
4.Quantity Sold
5.Cost & Profit
6.Region / Location
7.Customer Details

**Challenges in Raw Data**
1.Missing values
2.Duplicate sales records
3.Incorrect date formats
4.Inconsistent column names
5.Mixed data types
These issues were intentionally handled to simulate real-world business data problems.

**🧠 What I Learned from This Project**
-How to clean real, messy sales data using Python
-How to apply business logic such as profit and KPIs
-How to design SQL tables for analytics
-How to load data into SQL using Python
-How to connect Power BI to a SQL database
-How to create interactive dashboards for business users
-How to explain insights clearly for interviews and stakeholders

**Final Thoughts**
This project reflects real-world sales analytics work, not just theory.
It helped me understand how raw business data is transformed into meaningful insights that support decision-making.
